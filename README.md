## Transfer learning

### MED3D: TRANSFER LEARNING FOR 3D MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.00625.pdf) [code](https://github.com/Tencent/MedicalNet)
Tencent's pretrain model for medical image analysis, trained and tested on segmentation challanges, but pretrained on Medical data only.
seems promising, need to check.
## Semi-supervised

### MixMatch: A Holistic Approach to Semi-Supervised Learning [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.02249.pdf) [code](https://github.com/google-research/mixmatch)
Learning from minimal labeled + large unlabeled data by using aumentation and sharpening - seems intersting to segmentation variant - Need to try!

## Uncertanty estimation and lack of Ground truth

### Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation (STAPLE): An Algorithm for the Validation of Image Segmentation [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1283110/) [code1](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/56789-staple-d) [code-orig](http://crl.med.harvard.edu/software/STAPLE/request_access.php)
Using EM variant alogorithm for estimation of GT with varirty of segmentations (/algorithms).
The algorithm generates simultanously (M-step) Probablistic map of segmentation and then evaluate(E-step) the given segmentations vs the map. with extension to multiclass segmentation(partD) and global features(partE).
Note that the algorithm assumes pixels are iid so no matter 2D or 3D.
evalutaion was done on brain MRI and prostate MRI.

### Accuracy of transverse cerebellar diameter measurement by ultrasonography in the evaluation of foetal age [paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3ccd/f3d47a42c5fd401e843debda9c41e6ee9c56.pdf)
Shows that TCD is better predictor than other linear mesurement for IUGR. Note that this done on US (which have more noise than MRI) but may (and we can see it by the variance) be true also for MRI.
The foetal typo is original.

## Brain age estimation

### Assessment of MRI-Based Automated Fetal Cerebral Cortical Folding Measures in Prediction of Gestational Age in the Third Trimester[paper](http://www.ajnr.org/content/ajnr/early/2015/06/04/ajnr.A4357.full.pdf)
Estimation of brain age using volume and cortical folding (sulcuses). evaluate 8 types of measuring sulcuses and take the best fit. take care that they didnt have a lot of data but still they got 98% R-square.

### Deep Learning with Attention to Predict Gestational Age of the Fetal Brain [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.07102.pdf)
Using Unet+Attention on brain to estimate GA. Private DB of ~700 fetuses and straightforward(Medical) approach.
By using multi-view(Cor+Ax+Sag) they got better result.

In test, The code does not work on my GPU  (CUDA Error in patchBasedPSFReconstructionKernel(), line 132: too many resources requested for launch)

### Slice-to-Volume Registration Network (SVRnet) [code](https://github.com/farrell236/SVRnet) [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8295121/)
For me, There is need for dataset (They use iFind) So I will try to reconstruct one from equivoxel T2 (Preterm) and resample.

Using cascaded CNN and GAN for perceptual refinement for heart MRI. 3 to 9 fold, 1D variable density sampling.
Shows that SNR doesnâ€™t necessarily correlate with image quality and radiological interpretability.

 * We try to run this code and the results wasnt good - need to understand why.

### Deep Learning Based Multi-Modal Fusion for Fast MR Reconstruction [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8552399)
close idea, but for T1+ Undersampled T2 -> T2. 
take care that T2 has higher SNR than FLAIR inherently.
